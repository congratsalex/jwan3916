# This p5.js code snippet creates an interactive urban layout visualization.  It defines a Block class to generate both static and dynamic squares, representing buildings and streets, respectively.  The static blocks change size over time, while the dynamic blocks form a grid pattern like streets.  The setup（） function initializes the canvas with static blocks, and the draw（） function continually updates their display.  Block colors are randomly assigned through a colourMap（） function.  The windowResized（） function recalculates block layout when the browser window is resized to ensure the display adapts to new dimensions.
