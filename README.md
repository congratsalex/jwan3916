# This code uses JavaScript and the p5.js graphics library to create an animated canvas featuring both dynamic and static blocks. Static blocks have collision detection and scaling features, while dynamic blocks change color periodically. This is achieved through the Block class, which defines properties such as coordinates, dimensions, color, etc., and methods like display and update for showcasing and moving the blocks.

# The core functionalities are executed through the setup（） and draw（） functions, where setup performs the initial setup, and draw updates the canvas in each frame. Two setInterval（） timers are used to update the size of static blocks and the color of dynamic blocks, respectively. One timer calls every 5 seconds to update the scale of static blocks, and another timer calls every second to update the colors of dynamic blocks, achieving random color changes through the updateDynamicBlocksColor（） function.

# The windowResized（） function ensures that the layout of blocks is updated accordingly when the window size changes. The code also cleverly uses the calculatePositions（） function to adjust positions to fit different screen sizes. Overall, through the setInterval timers and the p5.js animation loop, this code creates a visually engaging and responsive user experience.
